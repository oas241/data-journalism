   <div id='right'> <h4> Haimson’s findings on overcrowding include:</h4>

<b>NOISE LEVELS:</b> Crowded schools
are noisier. A study by Gary Evans, a
psychologist at Cornell University, found
that, “Teachers in noisy schools are
more fatigued, annoyed, and less patient
than teachers in quieter schools.
Teachers in noisy schools also lose instruction
time due to noise distractions
and have a compromised teaching
style. Children exposed to chronic loud
noise also experience a rise in blood
pressure and stress hormones.” 

<p> <b>DENSITY (number of people per room):</b>
Crowded schools and crowded
class- rooms have a greater density of
people. Evans found that 10-12-yearold
children tend to withdraw in overcrowded situations, and “children
may engage in withdrawal behavior as a
means of coping with an over-stimulating
environment…” </p>

<p><b>IMPACT ON CLASS SIZE:</b> Students in
crowded schools tend to have larger
class sizes, which have a negative
effect on student learning. There are
a wealth of studies, both experimental
and correlational, demonstrating that
larger classes are detrimental to student
engagement, motivation, time on task,
achievement levels, and graduation rates. 

<p> <b>RESULTS IN TERMS OF LEARNING: </b> Many
studies show an association between
overcrowding and poor student outcomes,
particularly for low-income
students. An analysis conducted by the
Teachers College of Columbia University
in 1995 found that overcrowded schools
with a high proportion of low-income
students scored as much as nine percentage
points lower on achievement
tests than similar students in less crowded
schools. Many other studies have also
found negative associations between
crowded spaces and poor academic
outcomes, particularly among lowincome
and minority students.</p>


<p><b>PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES:</b>
Substandard school environments
have adverse psychological effects on
children. A study of overcrowded and
poorly maintained schools in California
found that students in these schools
exhibited anger and shame about the
relative deprivation in their schools.
Another study found positive relationships
between school conditions and student
behavior.30 A researcher concluded that
“the depressed physical environment
of many schools…is believed to reflect
society’s lack of priority for these children
and their education.” </p>

<p><b>TEACHING:</b> Teachers are more relaxed
and more effective when schools are
in good condition and facilities are
clean and well-maintained. Studies find
that teachers are more stressed, have
more absences, and are more likely to
experience “burnout” when schools are
overcrowded.

              <h4>Class Size Policies</h4>
              <p>Despite the known relationship between class size and student performance, class size policies are issued on a state-by-state basis and as of 2009, less than half of the states maintain class size reduction efforts. Although class size maximums have been defined, New York is not one of those states with sweeping class size reduction efforts. In fact, while the New York State Department of Education does fund a Contracts for Excellence budget specific to class size reduction within New York City alone, the 2009 recession forced the state to freeze their funding for several years. The setback, not unique to New York (three of the 23 participating states also lost funding due to economic downturns), caused a dangerous spike in overcrowding: More than 330,000 students attended classes of 30 or larger last year. Now, more than 480,000 students citywide are taught in extremely overcrowded buildings, according to Haimson’s report.   </p>
<p>
Every state with legislation addressing class size reduction with the exception of Texas set a maximum limit of 20 students per classroom. New York, however, doesn’t bar classes exceeding 20 students per room as long as there are two teaching assistants present. The most updated report issued by New York City this past November indicated that it would take upwards of 24 years in grades K-3 and 38 years in grades 4-8 to achieve reduced class size goals of TK set by the Contracts for Excellence budget. Some argue that the alarmingly sluggish progress will be undermined by the expansion of universal pre-K mandated by Mayor Bill de Blasio this past school year.
